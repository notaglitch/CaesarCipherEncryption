# Caesar Cipher in Cryptography
A very simple code to encrypt and decrypt a text message using Caesar Cipher encryption method.

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest methods of encrypting messages, named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it to protect his military communications. This technique involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of three, the letter ‘A’ becomes ‘D’, ‘B’ becomes ‘E’, and so on. Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher formed the groundwork for modern cryptographic techniques. In this article, we’ll explore how the Caesar Cipher works, its significance, and its impact on the development of cryptography with its advantages and disadvantages.
What is Caesar Cipher Technique?

The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”. The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption techniques.

It’s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials.
